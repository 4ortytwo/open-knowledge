# TileMill

## Intro

Tilemill is an open source map design software. It can import GIS data
from various sources and lets you design a map based on said data.
Tilemill was primarily created for exporting MBTiles-formatted raster
images, but can also be used to export single SVG, PDF or raster
images. Styling is achieved with CartoCSS, a css-like language which
allows users to describe what features should be displayed at what zoom
level in what appearance.

This guide explains how to create a poster similar to the following
image.
