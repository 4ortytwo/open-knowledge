See [GLOSSARY](glossary.md) for an explanation of the most important terms.

## Intro

In KiCad, a PCB project consists of a schematic and the PCB layout. The
schematic defines which components are present and what connections exist. The
PCB layout then defines the traces and planes of the finished PCB.
