# Dokku - Docker image deploys

Often times, it is easier to deploy a complete Docker image than to deploy the
source code of an application and trying to manually configure Dokku to run the
build steps required to launch the application.

In those cases, Dokku can deploy complete Docker images. The process to prepare
an application for a Docker image deploy is documented in this category.
