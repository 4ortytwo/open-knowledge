# Dokku

Dokku is a software suite that simulates a PaaS on any server. It uses the same
base functionality as Heroku and tries to mimic usage of Heroku as much as
possible. With Dokku, it's very easy to deploy software and run multiple
projects on the same physical server through the use of containers.
