# Shaping

## Rocker

The rocker is the curvature of the board cross section along the length of the board. The flatter the rocker is, the faster the surfer is able to paddle. The more curved, the larger the waves you are able to surf and the narrower your turns.

## Bottom shape

The bottom shape may be concave, double concave, belly (convex), v or flat:

* Convex: a bit slower, but easier with onshore wind, because the rails cut the water surface and prevent hopping
* Concave: Less rocker in the center than at the rails makes the board faster

## Rails

* Round: Good buoyancy, even during turns. Forgives small mistakes and works well in soft waves.
* Hard: Cut the surface of the water, stability during narrow turns.
